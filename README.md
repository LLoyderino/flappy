# Flappy Dragon
Simple game using `bracket-lib` in Rust

## Compilation
To compile use `cargo build --release` if you are running on windows

If you are running Rust on Debian-WSL (like me) you can compile it with
```
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

or if you are using VSCode you can just run the task `build win`
